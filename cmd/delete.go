	Use:   "delete <context> [stack-name]",
	Short: "Delete CloudFormation stacks",
	Long: `Delete CloudFormation stacks with dependency-aware ordering and confirmation prompts.

This command safely deletes CloudFormation stacks by:

• Resolving stack dependencies and deleting in reverse order
• Showing detailed information about what will be deleted
• Prompting for confirmation before deletion

When deleting multiple stacks, they are processed in reverse dependency order
to ensure dependent stacks are deleted before their dependencies.

Examples:
  stackaroo delete dev vpc        # Delete single stack with confirmation
  stackaroo delete dev            # Delete all stacks in context with confirmation

CAUTION: Deletion is destructive and cannot be undone. Always verify what
will be deleted before confirming.`,
