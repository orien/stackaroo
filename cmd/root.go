• Declarative configuration in YAML files
• Environment-specific parameter management
• Stack dependency resolution
• Template validation and deployment
• Rich terminal output with progress indicators

Use stackaroo to deploy, update, delete, and monitor your CloudFormation stacks
across multiple environments with consistent, repeatable configurations.`,
