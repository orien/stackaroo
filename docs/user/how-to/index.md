# ðŸ”§ How-to Guides

Use this page as a jump-off point for the most common Stackaroo configuration tasks. Each task links to a focused how-to.

- [Initialise Configuration](./initialise-configuration)
  - Capture project metadata, set the template directory, and define environment contexts.
- [Add a Stack](./add-stack)
  - Introduce new stacks, parameters, and per-context overrides.
- [Link Stack Dependencies](./link-stack-dependencies)
  - Declare `depends_on` relationships and reference outputs safely.
- [Validate and Preview](./validate-and-preview)
  - Run diffs to surface issues before deploying.

Follow the guides in order when bootstrapping a new project, or jump to the workflow you need when making incremental changes.
