# Stackaroo Documentation

This VitePress workspace is ready for Stackaroo’s user-facing documentation. We will organise content following the Diátaxis framework:

- Tutorials for first-time success.
- How-to guides for specific tasks.
- Explanations for reasoning and background.
- Reference material for authoritative details.

Draft content will be added incrementally as we curate each section.
