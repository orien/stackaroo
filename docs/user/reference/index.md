# Reference

This section will serve as the authoritative source for Stackarooâ€™s command-line interface, configuration schema, and operational limits. Entries here will emphasise precision and completeness, making it easy to verify exact flag names, parameter shapes, and exit codes.

As the documentation grows we will add cross-links to complementary tutorials and how-to guides for practical application.
