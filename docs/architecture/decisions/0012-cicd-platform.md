# 12. CI/Release platform choice

Date: 2025-08-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a Continuous Integration and Release Automation (CI/Release) platform for Stackaroo to ensure code quality, automated testing, and reliable binary distribution. As a Go-based CLI tool hosted on GitHub, we require automated workflows for:

Note: Unlike web applications or services, CLI tools don't have traditional "continuous deployment" to servers. Instead, they have "continuous release" - automated building and distribution of binaries to users via GitHub releases, package managers, and distribution channels.

Our requirements include:

- **Code quality assurance**: Automated testing, linting, and security scanning
- **Multi-platform builds**: Supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows across multiple architectures
- **Release automation**: Automated binary builds and distribution via GitHub releases
- **Package manager integration**: Automated updates to Homebrew, Chocolatey, etc.
- **Developer productivity**: Fast feedback loops and reliable CI/Release pipelines
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning and secure build processes

Key requirements:
- Integration with GitHub repository hosting
- Go language ecosystem support
- Multi-platform cross-compilation capabilities
- Automated GitHub release creation and binary distribution
- Cost-effective for open source projects
- Minimal maintenance overhead
- Scalable build infrastructure
- Security scanning and compliance features

Platform options considered:
- **GitHub Actions**: Native GitHub integration, excellent Go support, built-in release automation
- **GitLab CI**: Comprehensive CI features, Docker-native, requires separate GitLab setup
- **CircleCI**: Fast execution, good Go support, credit-based pricing model
- **Jenkins**: Self-hosted flexibility, complete control, significant maintenance overhead
- **Travis CI**: Historical Go support, declining popularity, pricing concerns
- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft ecosystem, good for enterprise, additional complexity for GitHub repos

## Decision

We will use **GitHub Actions** as our primary CI/Release platform for Stackaroo.

Key factors in this decision:
- **Native GitHub integration**: Seamless workflow triggers, PR integration, and release management
- **Zero additional setup**: No external accounts, configurations, or infrastructure required
- **Excellent Go ecosystem support**: Mature actions for Go testing, building, and releasing
- **Cost-effective**: Free for public repositories with generous compute limits
- **Multi-platform support**: Native support for Linux, macOS, and Windows builds
- **Rich marketplace**: Extensive library of pre-built actions for common tasks
- **Security features**: Built-in secret management, dependency scanning, and security alerts
- **Community adoption**: Widely used in the Go community with established best practices

**CI/Release Pipeline Components:**
- **Testing**: Multi-version Go testing with race detection and coverage reporting
- **Code quality**: Linting with golangci-lint, format checking, and security scanning
- **Multi-platform builds**: Cross-compilation for Linux, macOS, Windows (amd64, arm64)
- **Integration testing**: CLI functionality validation and basic smoke tests
- **Security scanning**: Gosec security analysis and govulncheck vulnerability detection
- **Release automation**: Automated GitHub releases with binary uploads on version tags
- **Distribution**: Future integration with package managers (Homebrew, Chocolatey, etc.)
- **Dependency management**: Automated dependency updates and security monitoring

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- **Zero maintenance overhead**: No infrastructure to manage or maintain
- **Native GitHub integration**: Seamless developer experience with familiar GitHub UI
- **Cost-effective**: Free for open source with no additional service costs
- **Scalable compute**: Automatic scaling with GitHub's infrastructure
- **Rich ecosystem**: Access to thousands of community-built actions
- **Security built-in**: Native secret management, dependency scanning, and audit logs
- **Fast setup**: Immediate availability without external service configuration
- **Community support**: Extensive documentation and community best practices
- **Release automation**: Native GitHub release integration with automated changelog generation

**Negative:**
- **Vendor lock-in**: Tightly coupled to GitHub platform (mitigated by industry standard YAML format)
- **Limited customization**: Less flexibility compared to self-hosted solutions
- **Shared compute resources**: Potential for slower builds during peak GitHub usage
- **GitHub dependency**: CI/CD availability tied to GitHub service availability
- **Action ecosystem dependency**: Reliance on third-party actions for specialized tasks

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Configure GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Set up multi-matrix builds for target platforms
- Configure security scanning with Gosec and govulncheck
- Implement automated release workflows triggered by version tags (not continuous deployment)
- Set up code coverage reporting and quality gates
- Configure secret management for package manager publishing credentials
- Establish branch protection rules requiring CI success before merge
- Configure release automation for binary distribution, not server deployment

**Migration Path:**
- If future requirements exceed GitHub Actions capabilities, the standard YAML workflow format provides reasonable portability to other CI/Release platforms
- Docker-based build steps can be migrated to other container-native CI systems
- Build scripts and test configurations remain platform-independent
- Release automation patterns are transferable to other platforms

**CLI Tool Release Model:**
Unlike web applications with continuous deployment to servers, Stackaroo follows a continuous release model where:
- Code changes trigger CI validation (testing, linting, security)
- Tagged versions trigger automated binary builds and GitHub releases
- Users download releases or install via package managers
- No servers or infrastructure require deployment

This choice aligns with industry best practices for Go CLI tools hosted on GitHub and provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and automating binary releases as the project scales.
